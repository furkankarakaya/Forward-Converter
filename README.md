# Forward-Converter

As a course project, a closed-loop controlled forward converter is designed using synchronous switching. Electrical and magnetic designs are successfully realized with respect to specifications given below. In order to control the converter an analog controller integrated circuit (IC) is used. In the secondary side another IC for synchronous switching and an opto-driver IC is implemented. These integrated circuits are selected from Analog Devices to take advantage of simulations. The whole circuitry is verified in simulation platform before schematic and printed circuit board (PCB) designs are completed. The PCB is manufactured using a CNC PCB machine.
